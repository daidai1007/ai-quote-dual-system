# Public release validation

Validated before the initial public-source release:

- Node.js syntax: `api/server.mjs`
- Node.js syntax: `export_dual_quote_workbook.mjs`
- Python syntax: `desktop_client/main.py`
- JSON syntax: public example configuration and request fixtures
- Secret scan: no production password, API key, customer record, local user path, or private drawing/template is included
- Git ignore rules: local configuration, virtual environments, build output, database backups, drawings, spreadsheets, and generated executables are excluded

## Excel exporter limitation

The Excel exporter currently imports `@oai/artifact-tool`. That runtime is not distributed in this repository. The calculation API and desktop client can still be developed without it, but workbook-export regression tests require a compatible implementation of that package or a replacement exporter.

## Data limitation

Migration files define schema and calculation behavior only. Real material prices, attachment prices, formula workbooks, customer history, drawings, and quick-quote experience data must be supplied separately with sanitized test data or local business data.
